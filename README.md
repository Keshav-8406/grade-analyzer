# Student Grade Analyzer  

This is a simple Python project that I built to process student marks, calculate their average scores, assign letter grades, and generate a clean summary report.

# What This Project Does

Calculates each student's average score (rounded to 2 decimal places)  

Assigns grades based on the average (A, B, C, F)  

Generates a formatted grade report  

Shows how many students passed and failed  


# How to Run the Program

Open the project folder in your terminal and run:
python grade_analyzer.py

That’s it! The report will be displayed in the console.
